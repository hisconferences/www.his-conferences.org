					<b>Title:</b> Ontologies in Data Management and Data Mining <br/>
	
          				<b>Speaker:</b> John Roddick, Flinders University, Australia<br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					The conceptual modelling community has been researching the use of ontologies for many years.  More recently, the accommodation of ontologies in data mining has also received some attention.  However, widespread deployment of ontologies eludes all but a few specific systems that cannot operate without them.  This talk will discuss why ontologies have largely failed to impact on most large corporate   information systems and outlines a few forgotten research areas which could help to solve this problem.

					<b>Biography:</b><br/>
					Professor John Roddick joined Flinders in April 2000 after 15 years at the Universities of Tasmania and South Australia (where he was Head of the School of Computer and Information Science for 4 years). This followed 10 years experience in the computing industry as (progressively) a programmer, analyst, project leader and consultant. He became Dean of the School in January 2008 and was reappointed to that role at the start of 2012. He is also Deputy Executive Dean for the Faculty of Science and Engineering.

					<b>Title:</b> Large Graph Processing Revisited <br/>
	
          				<b>Speaker:</b> Jeffrey Xu Yu, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, China<br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					In this talk, we discuss several interesting issues. From application
side, we discuss some interesting research issues related to online
social networks, such as finding influential community and social
hierarchy that is hidden in an online social network.  From system
side, we discuss two issues. First, we discuss graph partitioning
which is a key issue in graph computing to achieve high efficiency on
Cloud. However, the balanced graph partitioning itself is difficult
because it is known to be NP-complete. In addition a static graph
partitioning cannot keep all graph algorithms efficient for a long
time in parallel on Cloud because the workload balancing in different
iterations for different graph algorithms are all possible different.
Second, we discuss graph approximation computing on Cloud, which can
be used to find some insighs over a large graph to understand the
large graph.

					<b>Title:</b> Joint Modelling of User Check-in Behaviours for Point-of-Interest Recommendation <br/>
	
          				<b>Speaker:</b> Hongzhi Yin, The University of Queensland, Australia<br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important means to help people discover attractive and interesting locations, especially when users travel out of town. However, extreme sparsity of user-POI matrix creates a severe challenge. To cope with this challenge,  a growing line of research has exploited the temporal effect, geographical-social influence, content effect and word-of-mouth effect. However, current research lacks  an integrated analysis of the joint effect of the above factors to deal with the issue of data-sparsity, especially in the out-of-town recommendation scenario which has been ignored by most  existing work. In light of the above,  we propose a joint probabilistic generative model to mimic user check-in behaviours in a process of decision making,  which  strategically integrates the  above factors  to effectively overcome the data sparsity, especially for out-of-town users.  To demonstrate the applicability and flexibility of our model, we investigate how it supports  two  recommendation scenarios in a unified way, i.e.,  home-town recommendation and out-of-town recommendation.   We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our model  on two real large-scale datasets in terms of both recommendation effectiveness and efficiency, and  the experimental results show its superiority   over other competitors.

					<b>Title:</b> Optimal and Scalable Algorithms for Graph Processing <br/>
	
          				<b>Speaker:</b> Lijun Chang, The University of New South Wales, Australia<br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					With the proliferation of graph applications and the recent advent of Big Data, research efforts have been devoted towards many fundamental problems in managing and analysing big graph data. In this talk, I focus on optimal and scalable graph processing, and I study the problem of computing steiner components with maximum connectivity (SMCC). Given a set q of query vertices in a graph G, the problem of computing SMCC is to find the maximum induced subgraph g of G such that g contains q and g has the maximum connectivity. To accommodate online query processing, we present an efficient algorithm based on a novel index such that the algorithm runs in linear time regarding the result size; thus, the algorithm is optimal since it needs at least linear time to output the result. To build the index, we extend the existing techniques to accommodate batch processing and computation sharing. Comprehensive empirical studies demonstrate that our techniques may improve the existing techniques by orders of magnitude and our algorithms are scalable to big graphs.

					<b>Title:</b> Brain signal processing for discovering the brain abnormalities <br/>
	
          				<b>Speaker:</b> Siuly Siuly, Victoria University, Australia<br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					Brain signal processing is a procedure that provides a way for diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of mental and brain neuro-degenerative diseases and abnormalities. Brain abnormalities include more than 600 disorders, such as epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, brain tumours, migraine, and other headache disorders, multiple sclerosis and autism etc. To understand human neurophysiology, electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most frequently-used technique for studying the functional states of the brain. Measuring brain activity through EEG leads to the acquisition of a huge amount of data. Still, the evaluation of an EEG recording is conducted by experienced electroencephalographers or neurologists who visually scan the EEG records to identify and understand abnormalities within the brain and how they propagate. Visual inspection of EEG signals is not a satisfactory procedure because there are no standard criteria for the assessment and it is time-consuming, error-prone, and subject to fatigue. Therefore, there is an ever-increasing need for developing automatic systems to analysis and also to ensure the proper evaluation and treatment of brain abnormalities. Our current research focuses on the classification, detection and prediction of epileptic seizure from EEG signal data and also focuses on the identification of mental states from motor imagery based EEG signals to help patients who have severe motor disabilities. Our research aims to develop automatic real-time systems for detection and prediction of brain abnormalities from EEG data comprising mining algorithms at various levels of signal processing. By developing novel algorithms and models using EEG data, our research will help neurologists or experts to diagnose the brain disorders correctly and efficiently and also to provide appropriate early-warning indicative information to reduce health risks and enhance health monitoring systems.

					<b>Title:</b> Search result diversification based on complex intents  <br/>
	
          				<b>Speaker:</b> Zhicheng Dou, Associate Professor, Renmin University of China <br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					A large percentage of queries issued to search engines are broad or ambiguous. Search result diversification aims to solve this problem, by returning diverse results that can fulfill as many different information needs as possible. Most existing intent-aware search result diversification algorithms formulate user intents for a query as a flat list of subtopics. In this talk, I will introduce our approaches that diversify search results by leveraging query intents with more complex structures, such as multiple groups of subtopics, query facets, or hierarchical intents.

					<b>Title:</b> Search User Behavior Modeling <br/>
	
          				<b>Speaker:</b> Yiqun Liu, Associate Professor, Tsinghua University <br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					When users interact with information retrieval (IR) systems, they leave rich implicit feedback in the form of clicks, mouse movements etc. This feedback contains valuable information about users and about IR systems. Analyzing and interpreting user interactions and modeling user search behavior has become an important research topic in Web search studies. It enables us to better understand users, perform user simulations, improve search algorithms and build quality metrics. In this talk, I will at first introduce some existing efforts that are paid to understand the cognitive behavior of search users and focus on the characteristics of search users’ querying, clicking-through and examination behaviors. After that, I will talk about some recent trends in search behavior modeling. Especially, IR systems become more and more heterogeneous: they deal with information of various media types, structure and semantics; run on multiple devices and support a variety of short- and long-term search tasks; serve users with different background and preferences. We will focus on how to construct user behavior modeling to support effective IR methods in such heterogeneous environments.

					<b>Title:</b> Web Analysis Engine <br/>
	
          				<b>Speaker:</b> Ji-Rong Wen, Professor, Renmin University of China<br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					As the most commonly used tool to exploring big Web data, modern search engines have dramatically advanced in terms of functionality and performance in past two decades. However, the framework and underlying basic assumptions of search engines remain unchanged since 1960s. In this talk, we present our vision on building a new Web analysis engine, which targets to turn open Web data into a source for fast and comprehensive analysis, prediction and decision. As “analysis” is a far more complicated and costly task than “search”, it poses significant challenges on developing key component technologies such as data sensing, analysis models, data sampling and sketching, and so on. We introduce this new framework and present our recent progress on several key component technologies.
