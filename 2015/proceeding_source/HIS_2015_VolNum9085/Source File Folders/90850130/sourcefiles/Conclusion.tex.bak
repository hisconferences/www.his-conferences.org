\section{conclusion}
In this paper, we present an intelligent chatting system for sensing and releasing adolescents' stress. First, we built seven stress-related lexicons and used the natural language processing techniques to sense adolescents' stress. Then we designed the response strategies to act like a virtual friend to listen, comfort, encourage and understand the stressful adolescents to help release stress. Our user study showed a good result of \emph{TeenChat} in stress detection and stress release. In our future work, we will make use of abundant resources in social network to improve the response effect, including collecting more answers with higher pertinency and efficiency. Then another direction we will consider is how to further solve the privacy problem of chatting processing.\\
