    <td height="239"><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health data, although widely and diligently collected, continue to be under-utilised for research and evaluation. How to make use of the enormous amount of health data efficiently and effectively is one of fundamental issues that health researchers encounter today. Such research holds a great promise to improve the quality of patient care, prevent potential medical errors, and reduce healthcare cost. To accomplish this objective, the collaborations of both practical applications and theoretical research will be essential. Organized in conjunction with the International Conference on Health Information Science, the purpose of IWHDM’12 is to provide a forum for discussion and interaction among researchers with interests in the cutting edge issues of information Techniques in Health. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1st International Conference on Health Information Science (HIS 2012) aims to integrate computer science/information technology with health sciences & services, embracing information science research coupled with topics related to the modeling, design, development, integration, and management of health information systems.</p>

    <td height="117"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All  submissions should be in English. Submission of a paper should be regarded as  an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one author will attend  the conference to present the work. Papers should be  submitted in LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) format (style files are  available at LNCS Authors Instructions) as PostScript or PDF files and may not  exceed 8 pages, which is the same to the conference paper  submission/camera-ready.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All papers accepted by the  workshop will be published in a combined volume of Lecturer Notes in Computer  Science series published by Springer (pending for approval).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One special issue in journal: Health Information Science and System (Springer and BMC publisher) will be organized based on the accepted paper of HIS2012.
