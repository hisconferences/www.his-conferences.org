\begin{abstract}
More and more adolescents today are suffering from various adolescent stress.
Too much stress will bring a variety of physical and psychological problems
including anxiety, depression, and even suicide to the growing youths, whose
outlook on life and problem-solving ability are still immature enough.
Traditional face-to-face stress detection and relief methods do not work, confronted with adolescents who are reluctant
to express their negative emotions to the people in real life.
In this paper, we present a adolescent-oriented intelligent chatting system called \emph{TeenChat}, which acts as a virtual friend
to listen, understand, comfort, encourage, and guide stressful adolescents to pour out their bad feelings, and
thus releasing the stress. Our 1-month user study demonstrates \emph{TeenChat} is effective on sensing and helping adolescents' stress.
