					<p class="paragraph"><b>Title: </b><strong>Understanding and Promoting Human Health through Convergent Research and with Technology Convergence of Big Data and AI</strong></p>
					<p class="paragraph"><b>Abstract: </b>The purpose of science and technology development around the world is shifting to human well-being. The grand challenges facing human society in the twenty-first century, such as protecting human health and promoting human well-being, cannot be solved by one discipline alone. Comprehensive use of convergence knowledge, the merging of insights obtained through convergent research from widely diverse fields, can be expected to address these challenges. Convergence is a process that stimulates innovation and discovery and leads to the creation of new problem-driven solutions by multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary collaborations. In this talk, after introducing the promising paradigm of convergent research and the concept of convergence knowledge, we will depict our vision on computing for human well-being and technology for the common good. We will further present our recent work in understanding and promoting human health through convergent research and with technology convergence of big data and artificial intelligence, such as comprehensive health data analysis for healthcare, living support and well-being promotion for the elder people.</p>
					<p class="paragraph"><b>Bio: </b>Qun Jin is a professor in the Department of Human Informatics and Cognitive Sciences, Faculty of Human Sciences, Waseda University, Japan. He has been extensively engaged in research works in the fields of computer science, information systems, and human informatics, with a focus on understanding and supporting humans through convergent research. His recent research interests cover behavior and cognitive informatics, health informatics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, big data, personal analytics and individual modeling, trustworthy platforms for data federation, sharing, and utilization, cyber-physical-social systems, and applications in healthcare and learning support and for the realization of a carbon-neutral society. He authored or co-authored several monographs and more than 400 refereed papers published in academic journals and international conference proceedings. He served as a general chair, program chair, and keynote speaker for numerous IEEE/ACM sponsored international conferences. He served as a guest editor in recent years for IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, IEEE MultiMedia, and IEEE Cloud Computing.
