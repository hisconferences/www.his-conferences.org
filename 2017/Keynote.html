					<b>Title:</b> Orange Technology & AI Robot for Smart Hospital & Health Care <br/>
						
					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					The first ever World Happiness Report has been published recently by the United Nations, it reflects a new worldwide demand for more attention to health and happiness as criteria for government policy. This also calls upon science and technology in both natural and social domains to be developed for promoting a happy and healthy lifestyle in our modern society. <br><br>

					To meet such a world trend, the Orange Technology research has been first proposed in National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan in 2008. The Orange Technology refers to a newly evolved interdisciplinary research area for integration and innovation of health, happiness, and care technologies. The research scope includes computer science, electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, psychological/physiological science, cognitive science, and social science. The representative color of Orange Technology originates from a harmonic fusion of red (representing brightness of health and happiness) and yellow (representing warming care). Instead of emphasizing the relations between environments and humans, as proposed by green technology, the objective of Orange Technology will explore the innovative technologies to bring more health, happiness, warming care, and more mental wellness to the society. Henear e will inevitably work closely with bots. <br><br>

					Concerning about the AI robot applied in smart hospital, if we take the necessary steps now to gain better understanding of how they work, then the transition could be easier and simpler. For this reason, some interesting examples of robots in healthcare are presented such as Da vinci surgical robot, blood-drawing robot, robotic assistance for a better life, tele medical network system, disinfectant Robots in Healthcare, and TUG hospital robot, etc. <br><br>

					In addition to health informatics, the Happiness Informatics Research is also newly proposed accompanying with Orange technology. It will first sense the happiness behavior of the human being to get the happiness signals such as EEG brain signals, smiling sound signals & smiling face images etc. Then the information technology such as pattern recognition technique will be applied to detect & measure the happiness degree of the behavior based on the input signals. Finally, the system will give the suitable positive feedback to improve the happiness degree of the user. <br><br>

					In summary, the outline of this talk is shown below: <br>
					1.  Introduction to Orange Technology <br>
					2.  AI Robots for Smart Hospital and Health Care <br>
					3.  From health informatics to Happiness Informatics <br>
					4.  Conclusion and Future works <br>

					<b>Title:</b> Leveraging Big Data Analytics for HealthCare Applications <br/>
						
					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					Healthcare industry is one of the largest producers of Big Data, driven by record keeping, compliance and regulatory requirements, patient care, healthcare administration and research, as well as the growing volume of data generated from personal healthcare sensors and monitors and from a variety of social media channels. On one hand, Big Data Analytics and Big Data Technology hold the potential to transform healthcare delivery towards high quality and low cost, especially in clinical decision support, disease surveillance, and population health management. For example, according to a report by IHT2, the U.S. healthcare alliance network Premier has utilized its Big Data on resource utilization reports and transaction level cost data, collected from its 2,700 members, hospitals and health systems, 90,000 non-acute facilities and 400,000 physicians, to generate comprehensive and comparable clinical outcome measures. These outputs have improved healthcare decision-making processes at approximately 330 hospitals, saving an estimated 29,000 lives and reducing healthcare spending by nearly $7 billion.  On the other hand, Big data analytics and its applications also open doors for both intrusion of patient privacy and risks of misuse and abuse of Big Data in the absence of quality and usage governance. In this talk, I will examine the promise and potential of Big Data Analytics in improving quality and reducing cost of healthcare services through some real world examples. More importantly, I will explore some research opportunities and challenges in transformative development of Big Data technology towards the next generation of healthcare services.

					<b>Title:</b> A comprehensive curation of CRISPR annotations <br/>

				 	<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	CRISPR is an array of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, and plays an active role in regulating foreign invasive elements in the prokaryotic genomes. Recently CRISPR has been engineered as a genomic editing tool to conduct a target-specific gene editing in the mammalian genomes. CRISPR-associated gene (Cas) encodes an enzyme to facilitate the editing machinery, and the most well-studied system is the CRISPR-Cas9 pair. We carried out a comprehensive curation of the existing annotation of CRISPRs in the prokaryotic genomes, and observed quite a number of inconsistency in the annotations. The observed results demonstrated that it’s essential to sensitively detect the direct repeats (DRs) for a CRISPR detection program. The comparison with the existing tools also supports this suggestion.					<br/>

					<b>Title:</b> Robust identification of Retinal Layers through OCT imaging in the Presence of Pathology <br/>

				 	<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging technology is becoming more popular for screening retina and choroid due to its ability to investigate tissue structures. OCT shows very clear changes in the retinal tissue layers when retinal diseases are present. Fast technology of OCT imaging such as Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) and Enhanced Depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT), make it possible to capture retinal tissues layers and choroid in 3D. The retina has 10 tissue layers, and the choroid tissue is located underneath the retina and supplies oxygen to retina, any damage to this tissue is a precursor to retinal diseases. Our aim is to detect the retinal tissues layers and choroid automatically in the presence of pathologies such as drusen and geographic atrophy. At this stage we can detect all the tissues layers and choroid. In this talk I present our algorithm for detecting various layers using shortest path by representing the image as a graph where the relevant pixels of the image form the nodes of the graph and edge weights between nodes  are formed  using the spatial distance between nodes, slope similarity to a reference line and non-associativity of the layer, etc. We found this  has helped to overcome the distorting effects that pathology can play in the boundary determination. Our method is highly accurate, robust, reliable and consistent. Our method can enable to quantify the biomarkers for the retinal diseases in large scale study for assessing, monitoring disease progression as well as early detection of retinal diseases.

				 	<b>Title:</b> Computational Intelligence Techniques in Gait Data Modelling <br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	Analysis of the walking gait underpins research in many medical and applied health science domains, such as clinical gait analysis, sport performance, ageing, and rehabilitation. The common goals are evaluating locomotor function to detect abnormalities, determining effects due to ageing, disease, or trauma and evaluating systematically the individual’s walking pattern. Traditional statistical techniques have provided only limited success in describing the complex relationship between various measures and the overall gait functional state. On the other hand, greater successes have been reported using non-linear modelling of human gait such as the artificial neural networks, support vector machines and fuzzy clustering. This talk will focus on some of the recent research undertaken in the area of computational intelligence techniques applied to diagnosis and assessment of gait function.

        				<b>Title:</b> Build a Cloud Infrastructure to Support Home-Based Care Systems for Elderly People
-- Challenges and Solutions
<br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	The aging of population is a worldwide trend. It is a big issue that governments and human societies have to heal with. As China has the largest population in the world, this issue is more challenging than any other countries. To build a cloud Infrastructure to support home-based care systems for elderly people is a feasible and economical way for solving it. There are many existing works toward this direction. It is expected home-based care systems for elderly people will form a huge market and thus create a big industry. However, from many perspectives, we can see a big gap between this expectation and reality. In this talk, I'll identify some of the problems in this regard and explore their possible solutions.

       					<b>Title:</b> Evidence Based Medicine: a confusion of numbers – supporting the effective utilisation of information.<br/>
					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	“Trust me I am a Doctor” – patients hold doctors in great regard but modern medicine, although striving to make a difference, has failed to realise the expected / anticipated gains. Doctors claim to utilise and promote evidence based practice in an information rich environment yet we still hurt between 10 to 15% of our patients, fail to deliver the agreed level of care in up to 50% and take 17 years to adopt level 1 and 2 evidenced practice.
This talk will look at the challenge of modern medicine: the provision of health care to patients with the objective of achieving health for the purpose of living. Utilising examples from the operating theatre and clinical environment, key challenges that face the health information community will be explored – how do we promote health information management so as to maximise health service delivery.
The target is how do we support and achieve the full benefits from our data and information when delivered in a complex adaptive system that has utilised population data to inform us in our quest for quality care for individuals in the future, when we know that past performance is not necessarily a predictor of future performance and everyone is different.
