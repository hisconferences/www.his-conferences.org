\chapter*{Preface}
%
The International Conference Series on Health Information Science (HIS) provides
a forum for disseminating and exchanging multidisciplinary research results
in computer science/information technology and health science and services. It
covers all aspects of health information sciences and systems that support health
information management and health service delivery.

The Fourth International Conference on Health Information Science (HIS 2015)
was held in Melbourne, Australia, during May 28 -- 30, 2015. Founded in April 2012 as the International Conference on Health Information Science and their Applications, the conference continues to grow to include an ever broader scope of activities. The main goal of these events is to provide international scientific forums for exchange of new ideas in a number of fields that interact in-depth through discussions with their peers from around
the world. The scope of the conference includes: (1) medical/health/biomedicine information resources, such as patient medical records, devices and equipments, software and tools to capture, store,
retrieve, process, analyze, and optimize the use of information in the health domain,
(2) data management, data mining, and knowledge discovery, all of which
play a key role in decision making, management of public health, examination of
standards, privacy and security issues, (3) computer visualization and artificial intelligence for computer-aided diagnosis, and (4) development of new architectures and applications for health information systems.

The conference has solicited and gathered technical research submissions related to all
aspects of the conference scope. All the submitted papers in the proceeding
were peer reviewed by at least three international experts drawn from the Program Committee. After the rigorous peer-review process, a total of 20 full papers and 5 short papers among 45 submissions were selected on the basis of originality, significance, and clarity and were accepted for publication in the proceeding. The authors were from 12 countries, including Australia, China, Finland, Germany, Malaysia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Switzerland, Pakistan, the UK, and the USA. Some papers will be invited to submit the extended versions of their papers to a special issue of the Health Information Science and System Journal, published by BioMed Central (Springer) and the World Wide Web Journal.

The high quality of the program - guaranteed by the presence of an unparalleled number of internationally recognized top experts - can be assessed when reading the contents of the proceeding. The conference will therefore be a unique event, where attendees will be able to appreciate the latest results in their field of expertise, and to acquire additional knowledge in other fields. The program has been structured to favor interactions among attendees coming from many different horizons, scientifically, geographically, from academia and from industry.

We would like to sincerely thank our keynote and invited speakers:
