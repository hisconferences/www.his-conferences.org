					Health care service, in order to improve the quality and reduce the cost of medical services, has welcomed the modern information and computing technology involved. In the past two decades, the modern medical equipment, as advanced the medical information acquisition and the produced big data can be analyzed to aid the decision makings. The medical professionals have appreciated the extensive employments of data storage, data management and communication which enhance the medical services. With the development of big data, supercomputing, virtualization, cloud computing are recently more available, moderate, and secure. For example, if wireless sensor networks are related, the information becomes available in the “cloud” from where it can be produced by a doctor and analyzed by an expert or even a computer. Nevertheless, the traditional cloud computing techniques cannot meet our daily increasing requirements and we can do more for the future and tailor the cloud computing for health care service. The cloud computing for health care is to enhance the acquisition and computing of big health data which will be the topic of this special issue. Cloud computing for health care is to improve the time and space efficiency and reduce the cost of health care by advanced cloud computing technology on storage, management and sharing techniques of big health data. The popularity of the cloud computing for health care can be displayed by its use in marketing to sell hosted services that run client servers of ware on a remote location. In this way, cloud for health care designs to integrate every available resource into individuals’ health care, analyzing data, modeling, filtering and showing useful messages and giving final health care suggestions. While it is exciting to have health care services in the cloud for everyone, there are many security and privacy risks that may impede its wide adoption. Cloud service for health care can possibly be defined as devices and services for patients and health service providers and implementations of interoperable standards used with the aim of improving health of a given population (globally, nationally etc. or individually).</br>
