				<p><span class="style1"><strong>Title</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Changing human roles and responsibilities in the  digital transformation of health systems </p>
				<p align="justify"><span class="style1"><strong>Abstract</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Much of the talk about digital  transformation in healthcare heightens our expectations of how it will improve  our health systems. However much less is said about how we must also change our  expectations of ourselves, our roles and our responsibilities, before such  improvements can be realised. Increasingly sophisticated digital technologies -  such as artificial intelligence, mobile apps, online social networks, robotics,  virtual environments and wearable sensors – give us great ability to reshape  the design and delivery of healthcare. On one hand, the way that the potential  impact of these technologies is described often makes it seem as if such  changes will happen in healthcare automatically, with no human involvement  required. On the other hand, we know that healthcare serves the needs of very  large numbers of people and is serviced by a very large part of the workforce  in most societies, and that many people now are being exposed to new healthcare  practices that most have not yet understood or experienced. Research underway  at the University of Melbourne highlights some of the new roles and  responsibilities becoming available to human actors in health - namely citizens  and patients, clinicians and other care providers, teachers and researchers,  health service managers and policy makers, and health information professionals  – in society’s efforts to ensure that digital health actually improves health  system performance. Many examples of innovative role descriptions and  newly-defined accountabilities are emerging, including biomedical citizen  scientists, e-patients, clinical information officers, health data scientists,  clinical simulation educators, health cybersecurity managers, and digital  health facilitators.                </p>

				<b>Title:</b> Overview of current large-scale initiatives in Spain in Digital Health, Big Data and Precision Medicine <br/>
						
				<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
				After my return to Spain in July 2017, I had the opportunity to appreciate the advances that have taken place in Spain in areas related to the application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Health. Spain has a publicly funded healthcare system with universal coverage, both in primary and specialized care. The management of healthcare is decentralized, with competences transferred to the 17 regions and 2 cities that make up the state. Spain has a health expenditure of 9% of GDP and a life expectancy rate among the highest in the world, however it faces several challenges, among which we can mention the aging of the population, the increase in chronicity, the need for greater prevention, the improvement of quality and the variability in healthcare services. ICT is an essential tool to improve the quality and efficiency of health services and the country has made a considerable effort in recent years to deploy clinical and public health information systems. Although the implementation of electronic medical record, electronic prescription, and telemedicine is currently a reality, with implantation rates close to 100%, there are numerous opportunities for improvement in areas such as interoperability of systems, creation of repositories of clinical data for secondary use, precision medicine, the professionalization of health informatics and the increase of digital competences in health professionals. In my presentation I will describe the initiatives that are being launched in the last year to address these challenges, including the creation of the CROSADIS Research Center, the national Precision Medicine initiative, the Big Data in Health project and the Professionalization Forum for Health Informatics. -->

				<p><strong class="style1">Title: </strong>Machine Learning for Precision Medicine: Promises, Challenges and Opportunities</p>
				<p align="justify"><span class="style1">Abstract: </span>Precision medicine refers to the paradigm of providing the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. With the rapid development of health and computer technologies, more and more health data are becoming readily available nowadays. Machine Learning and AI techniques hold great promises to dig insights from those data that are helpful for precision medicine. In this talk, I will give an overview of the research that my lab has done in recent years on developing machine learning methods for analyzing various health data including Electronic Health Records (EHR), medical images, pharmaceutical research and development data, biomedical literature, physiological signal streams, as well as conversational data. I will also discuss the challenges on this topic and future opportunities.</p>

					<b>Title:</b> Leveraging Big Data Analytics for HealthCare Applications <br/>
						
					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					Healthcare industry is one of the largest producers of Big Data, driven by record keeping, compliance and regulatory requirements, patient care, healthcare administration and research, as well as the growing volume of data generated from personal healthcare sensors and monitors and from a variety of social media channels. On one hand, Big Data Analytics and Big Data Technology hold the potential to transform healthcare delivery towards high quality and low cost, especially in clinical decision support, disease surveillance, and population health management. For example, according to a report by IHT2, the U.S. healthcare alliance network Premier has utilized its Big Data on resource utilization reports and transaction level cost data, collected from its 2,700 members, hospitals and health systems, 90,000 non-acute facilities and 400,000 physicians, to generate comprehensive and comparable clinical outcome measures. These outputs have improved healthcare decision-making processes at approximately 330 hospitals, saving an estimated 29,000 lives and reducing healthcare spending by nearly $7 billion.  On the other hand, Big data analytics and its applications also open doors for both intrusion of patient privacy and risks of misuse and abuse of Big Data in the absence of quality and usage governance. In this talk, I will examine the promise and potential of Big Data Analytics in improving quality and reducing cost of healthcare services through some real world examples. More importantly, I will explore some research opportunities and challenges in transformative development of Big Data technology towards the next generation of healthcare services.

					<b>Title:</b> A comprehensive curation of CRISPR annotations <br/>

				 	<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	CRISPR is an array of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, and plays an active role in regulating foreign invasive elements in the prokaryotic genomes. Recently CRISPR has been engineered as a genomic editing tool to conduct a target-specific gene editing in the mammalian genomes. CRISPR-associated gene (Cas) encodes an enzyme to facilitate the editing machinery, and the most well-studied system is the CRISPR-Cas9 pair. We carried out a comprehensive curation of the existing annotation of CRISPRs in the prokaryotic genomes, and observed quite a number of inconsistency in the annotations. The observed results demonstrated that it’s essential to sensitively detect the direct repeats (DRs) for a CRISPR detection program. The comparison with the existing tools also supports this suggestion.					<br/>

					<b>Title:</b> Robust identification of Retinal Layers through OCT imaging in the Presence of Pathology <br/>

				 	<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging technology is becoming more popular for screening retina and choroid due to its ability to investigate tissue structures. OCT shows very clear changes in the retinal tissue layers when retinal diseases are present. Fast technology of OCT imaging such as Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) and Enhanced Depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT), make it possible to capture retinal tissues layers and choroid in 3D. The retina has 10 tissue layers, and the choroid tissue is located underneath the retina and supplies oxygen to retina, any damage to this tissue is a precursor to retinal diseases. Our aim is to detect the retinal tissues layers and choroid automatically in the presence of pathologies such as drusen and geographic atrophy. At this stage we can detect all the tissues layers and choroid. In this talk I present our algorithm for detecting various layers using shortest path by representing the image as a graph where the relevant pixels of the image form the nodes of the graph and edge weights between nodes  are formed  using the spatial distance between nodes, slope similarity to a reference line and non-associativity of the layer, etc. We found this  has helped to overcome the distorting effects that pathology can play in the boundary determination. Our method is highly accurate, robust, reliable and consistent. Our method can enable to quantify the biomarkers for the retinal diseases in large scale study for assessing, monitoring disease progression as well as early detection of retinal diseases.

				 	<b>Title:</b> Computational Intelligence Techniques in Gait Data Modelling <br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	Analysis of the walking gait underpins research in many medical and applied health science domains, such as clinical gait analysis, sport performance, ageing, and rehabilitation. The common goals are evaluating locomotor function to detect abnormalities, determining effects due to ageing, disease, or trauma and evaluating systematically the individual’s walking pattern. Traditional statistical techniques have provided only limited success in describing the complex relationship between various measures and the overall gait functional state. On the other hand, greater successes have been reported using non-linear modelling of human gait such as the artificial neural networks, support vector machines and fuzzy clustering. This talk will focus on some of the recent research undertaken in the area of computational intelligence techniques applied to diagnosis and assessment of gait function.

        				<b>Title:</b> Build a Cloud Infrastructure to Support Home-Based Care Systems for Elderly People
-- Challenges and Solutions
<br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	The aging of population is a worldwide trend. It is a big issue that governments and human societies have to heal with. As China has the largest population in the world, this issue is more challenging than any other countries. To build a cloud Infrastructure to support home-based care systems for elderly people is a feasible and economical way for solving it. There are many existing works toward this direction. It is expected home-based care systems for elderly people will form a huge market and thus create a big industry. However, from many perspectives, we can see a big gap between this expectation and reality. In this talk, I'll identify some of the problems in this regard and explore their possible solutions.

       					<b>Title:</b> Evidence Based Medicine: a confusion of numbers – supporting the effective utilisation of information.<br/>
					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	“Trust me I am a Doctor” – patients hold doctors in great regard but modern medicine, although striving to make a difference, has failed to realise the expected / anticipated gains. Doctors claim to utilise and promote evidence based practice in an information rich environment yet we still hurt between 10 to 15% of our patients, fail to deliver the agreed level of care in up to 50% and take 17 years to adopt level 1 and 2 evidenced practice.
This talk will look at the challenge of modern medicine: the provision of health care to patients with the objective of achieving health for the purpose of living. Utilising examples from the operating theatre and clinical environment, key challenges that face the health information community will be explored – how do we promote health information management so as to maximise health service delivery.
The target is how do we support and achieve the full benefits from our data and information when delivered in a complex adaptive system that has utilised population data to inform us in our quest for quality care for individuals in the future, when we know that past performance is not necessarily a predictor of future performance and everyone is different.
