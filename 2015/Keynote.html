        				<b>Title:</b> Proprietary IC-based electrocardiogram devices and systems for the National Low-cost healthcare project <br/>
					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					The increasing aged populations worldwide generate a significant challenge to the healthcare providers. Thanks to the latest technologies in bioelectronics, which enable ubiquitous monitoring of the patients’ electrocardiogram (ECG) under their natural physiological states so that transient but life threatening abnormalities could be detected or even predicted. However, most of these ECG data acquisition devices employ off-the-shelf components, which inhibit further performance improvements in terms of power consumption, miniaturization and system reliability. In this talk, Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) design methodology and affiliated turn-key solutions for multiple lead ECG data acquisition are demonstrated. I will illustrate why Low frequency Low noise Low power (3Ls) are critical for this type of medical devices and how the 3Ls could be achieved by means of circuit-level and system-level innovations.

					<b>Title:</b> Bioinformatics for Human Health<br/>

				 	<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	In this talk, I will briefly present biomarker discovery and prediction techniques for disease diagnosis such as childhood leukemia, lung cancer and HCV. I also present 3-dimensional binding site prediction methods which I have applied for the conformational B-cell epitope prediction for antigens related to influenza. The data sets involved are all high-dimensional and complicated. I will conclude that advanced data mining algorithms are useful for systematic and efficient studies of contemporary biomedical problems.

				 	<b>Title:</b> Computational Intelligence Techniques in Gait Data Modelling <br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	Analysis of the walking gait underpins research in many medical and applied health science domains, such as clinical gait analysis, sport performance, ageing, and rehabilitation. The common goals are evaluating locomotor function to detect abnormalities, determining effects due to ageing, disease, or trauma and evaluating systematically the individual’s walking pattern. Traditional statistical techniques have provided only limited success in describing the complex relationship between various measures and the overall gait functional state. On the other hand, greater successes have been reported using non-linear modelling of human gait such as the artificial neural networks, support vector machines and fuzzy clustering. This talk will focus on some of the recent research undertaken in the area of computational intelligence techniques applied to diagnosis and assessment of gait function.

        				<b>Title:</b> Build a Cloud Infrastructure to Support Home-Based Care Systems for Elderly People
-- Challenges and Solutions
<br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	The aging of population is a worldwide trend. It is a big issue that governments and human societies have to heal with. As China has the largest population in the world, this issue is more challenging than any other countries. To build a cloud Infrastructure to support home-based care systems for elderly people is a feasible and economical way for solving it. There are many existing works toward this direction. It is expected home-based care systems for elderly people will form a huge market and thus create a big industry. However, from many perspectives, we can see a big gap between this expectation and reality. In this talk, I'll identify some of the problems in this regard and explore their possible solutions.

       					<b>Title:</b> Evidence Based Medicine: a confusion of numbers – supporting the effective utilisation of information.<br/>
					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	“Trust me I am a Doctor” – patients hold doctors in great regard but modern medicine, although striving to make a difference, has failed to realise the expected / anticipated gains. Doctors claim to utilise and promote evidence based practice in an information rich environment yet we still hurt between 10 to 15% of our patients, fail to deliver the agreed level of care in up to 50% and take 17 years to adopt level 1 and 2 evidenced practice.
This talk will look at the challenge of modern medicine: the provision of health care to patients with the objective of achieving health for the purpose of living. Utilising examples from the operating theatre and clinical environment, key challenges that face the health information community will be explored – how do we promote health information management so as to maximise health service delivery.
The target is how do we support and achieve the full benefits from our data and information when delivered in a complex adaptive system that has utilised population data to inform us in our quest for quality care for individuals in the future, when we know that past performance is not necessarily a predictor of future performance and everyone is different.

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

				 	Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have made DNA sequencing orders of magnitude faster and cheaper than ever before. Massive amounts of sequence data are being generated daily. The ushering of personal genomics era brings significant computational challenges on how to handle the large scale genomic data in a daily life. In this talk, I first review challenges and opportunities in the area of biological data management, and then I’ll briefly introduce our ongoing project, a biological data management platform. 					<br/>
