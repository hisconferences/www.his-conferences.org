\section{User Study }
\subsection{Experimental Setup}
We invited 10 students (aged between 15 and 22) from a high school and a university to participate in our 1-month study. We chose these students because the  majority of the adolescent group are students and the selected students were suffering from more or less stress, as evidenced by their Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS-14) results~\cite{SC1983}, which is commonly used to measure human stress level worldwide in psychology. To begin with, the users were told that \emph{Teenchat} was a chatting system which could help them release stress and they could chat with \emph{Teenchat} whenever necessary. During the experiment,we asked the users to do the following things: 1) Fill in the Chinese CPSS questionnaire every week to record the change of their stress status. 2) Evaluate the releasing effect of each conversation. 3) Give the ground truth to the stress status of each sentence in the conversation.
\subsection{Experimental Results}
After the 1-month user study, we obtained: 1) 62 conversations and 1063 chatting sentences in all, namely 6.2 conversations for each user and 17.2 utterances for each conversation in average. 2) 5 Chinese CPSS questionnaires for each user which record their change of  stress status.\\
\textbf{The accuracy of stress detection. }
 For each conversation, we return the stress detection result of each sentence to the user and ask the user to judge whether it is right or not. We use the Precision and Recall rate to evaluate the accuracy of stress detection. As Table~\ref{tab:stress_detection} shows, the detection of stress existence has a good result with the precision rate of 78.34\% and recall rate of 76.12\%. For the detection of stress category, the recall of \emph{affection} and \emph{inter-personal} and the precision of \emph{general} are lower than other categories, because some \emph{affection} and \emph{inter-personal} stress are denoted to the \emph{general} stress. Apparently, the stress detection on study, the most common adolescent stress category, has the overall best result with the precision rate of 86.20\% and the recall rate  of 75.00\%.\\
\textbf{The effectiveness of stress release. }
We evaluate the effectiveness of stress release from three aspects:
\\\textit{The evaluation for the releasing effectiveness of each conversation.}
Users were asked to give a mark (1-5: represent feeling worse, not changed, a bit better, better and much better respectively) to evaluate the stress releasing effectiveness by each conversation. Fig.~\ref{fig:score} shows that more than 60\% conversations get a score higher than 2, namely, making the user feel better. And \emph{Teenchat} is more effective in releasing study stress for the detection result of study has higher accuracy.

\textit{The change mode of stressful sentence ratio in a conversation.}
For each conversation, we equally divide the whole chatting process into three stages ($early$, $middle$ and $late$) according to time and compute the ratio of stressful sentences in each stage, then we analyze the change $Change_n$ from one stage $Ratio_n$ to the next stage $Ratio_{n+1} (Change_n=(Ratio_{n+1}-Ratio_n)/Ratio_{n+1})$. We consider $Change_n$ within $\pm10\%$ as stable($\rightarrow$), $Change_n$ more than $10\%$ as ascend($\uparrow$) and $Change_n$ less than $-10\%$ as descend($\downarrow$). We consider that  the first four change modes of stressful sentence ratio, denoted by column 2 and column3, mean \emph{TeenChat} is effective  and the next five change modes mean noneffective. As Table~\ref{tab:changemode} shows, column 4 reports the frequency of conversations that satisfy the corresponding change mode and the percentage is shown in column 5. Column 6 and 7 report the sum of frequency and percentage of effective and noneffective conversations respectively.

For each user, we asked them to fill the Chinese CPSS questionnaire to record the evolving of their stress status, in which higher score represents heavier stress. We consider that score decreasing means the stress status has been improved, score increasing means the stress status has been deteriorated. The Table~\ref{tab:CPSS} shows that more and more users are feeling better as time goes by.
