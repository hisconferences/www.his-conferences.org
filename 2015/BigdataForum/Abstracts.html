					<b>Title:</b> Web Data Management in the RDF Age <br/>
	
          				<b>Speaker:</b> M. Tamer &Ouml;zsu, University of Waterloo, Canada<br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					Web data management has been a topic of interest for many years during which a number of different modelling approaches have been tried. The latest in this approaches is to use RDF (Resource Description Framework), which seems to provide real opportunity for querying at least some of the web data systematically. RDF has been proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for modeling Web objects as part of developing the "semantic web". W3C has also proposed SPARQL as the query language for accessing RDF data repositories. The publication of Linked Open Data (LOD) on the Web has gained tremendous momentum over the last number of years, and this provides a new opportunity to accomplish web data integration. A number of approaches have been proposed for running SPARQL queries over RDF-encoded Web data: data warehousing, SPARQL federation, and live linked query execution. In this talk, I will review these approaches with particular emphasis on some of our research within the context of gStore project (joint project with Prof. Lei Zou of Peking University and Prof. Lei Chen of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology), chameleon-db project (joint work with Günes Aluç, Dr. Olaf Hartig, and Prof. Khuzaima Daudjee of University of Waterloo), and live linked query execution (joint work with Dr. Olaf Hartig).<br/>

					<b>Title:</b> Building and Application of Association Network <br/>
	
          				<b>Speaker:</b> Wei Wang, Fudan University, China<br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					Many knowledge systems such as knowledge graph, knowledge base used association network to manage the information. In existing work, the edge between the nodes is stable. But in some application such as financial information system, the relationship between the nodes is dynamic. For example, the most similar stock is different at different period. In some case, It changes frequently. So how to manage the dynamic association network becomes a challenge. In this talk, I will present the architecture of the dynamic association network data, as well as some key technique such as association detection of massive sequences, index structure, query processing.<br/>

					<b>Title:</b> Audio/Video Big Search: Beyond Content and Context  <br/>
	
          				<b>Speaker:</b> Shuqiang Jiang, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)<br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					The problem of audio/video search has been studied for decades and many methods have been proposed in the past, which can be mainly categorized into two types: content-based and context-based methods. Content-based audio/video search tries to fully utilize the abundance of information in the content whether from aural/visual similarity perspective or from the semantic understanding perspective. As audio/video data do not exist along, context-based methods use contextual information related with the audio/video data to facilitate fast and accurate search. Available contextual information include surrounding text, tag, geo-information, social information etc. Currently, audio-video data are growing very fast and are used in many places like Internet, video surveillance, mobile or social platforms etc. On the other hand, users’ requirements on audio/video data are becoming diversity. They not only want to find the explicit information, but also the implicit information and indirect knowledge from all the available multi-source data. Traditional content and context based methods could not meet these requirements. This talk first reviews past and current researches on audio/video information search. Secondly, under the whole framework of big search, I will introduce and analysis audio/video big search, which has several properties such as cross-source audio/video connection and association, intelligent audio/video understanding, and smart audio/video search.  In the end, this talk will provide some perspectives on future audio/video search applications with the help of audio/video big search.<br/>

					<b>Title:</b> Discovering and Selecting Valuable Sources for Integration <br/>
	
          				<b>Speaker:</b> Divesh Srivastava, AT&T Labs-Research<br/>

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>
					Data is becoming a commodity of tremendous value for many domains.  This is leading to a rapid increase in the number of autonomous data sources, which exhibit wide variety and heterogeneity in the types of the data they provide, their quality, and the cost of accessing their data. Users who want to build upon such data, must (i) discover sources that are relevant to their applications, (ii) identify sources that collectively satisfy the quality and budget requirements of their applications, with few effective clues about the quality of the sources, and (iii) repeatedly invest many person-hours in assessing the eventual usefulness of data sources. All three steps require investigating the content of the sources manually, integrating them and evaluating the actual benefit of the integration result for a desired application. Unfortunately, when the number of data sources is large, humans have a limited capability of reasoning about the actual quality of sources and the trade-offs between the benefits and costs of acquiring and integrating sources. In this talk, we focus on the problems of automatically appraising the quality of data sources and identifying the most valuable sources for diverse applications.
